# GDP by World Time Zones
I was once wondering: *"How many Time Zones are there in the world?"*. I was incredibly surprised by finding out that the total number of all time zones in relation to UTC equals to **42**.

Since I was working in a company making Data Analysis and Visualization for foreign entities, we always had to manage time differences which often led to huge overwork. Thus, I wanted to optimize our time by focusing on the time zones with higher GDP. My hypothesis was, if we dedicate more effort to the parts of the world with greater Gross Domestic Product, the 'Earning to time spent' ratio of our company would be much larger. 

As a result, I decided to collect GDP data of as many countries as possible *(even small islands)* and separate it by every possible time zone we have on the planet Earth and visualize it for my company to make efficient decisions. 

ðŸ˜‰ Thereby, you can also use this dashboard built in [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com) for making better decisions or just for having fun my friends! ðŸ˜‰

## Findings and Lessons Learned

* China, having the second GDP in the world, has only two time zones. This makes it really easy to work with different parts of the country.

    ~ *It also makes the **UTC +08:00** time zone the richest among the others.*

* The GDP of California State is almost equal to that of The United Kingdom.
* In term of GDP, **UTC -05:00** approximately equals to **UTC -07:00**, **UTC +02:00**, **UTC +03:00**, **UTC -08:00**, **UTC -07:00** and **UTC +-00:00** all together.

We are still testing our hypothesis and are in the way to obtain as many insights as we can. However, due to the visualized data it has become much easier to take actions ðŸ˜€

## Data Table
The data is aggrerated in Google Sheets. Through the link below you will be able to see all sheets that I used; however the main table containing the final data is called 'Main Table'.
